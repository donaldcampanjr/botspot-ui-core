# ✅ BotSpot – Builder.io AI Instructions & Deployment Checklist

## Systematically Enforce These Rules

- [ ] Always apply Tailwind classes using the existing `tailwind.config.js` tokens.
- [ ] Always include light mode / dark mode support using `prefers-color-scheme` and `.dark` class.
- [ ] Always apply **glass variants**: `.glass`, `.glass-frosted`, and `.glass-liquid` using shared utilities.
- [ ] Never generate JSX in `.js` files — all components/hooks using JSX go in `.jsx` files.
- [ ] Triple-check all import/export naming matches.
- [ ] Validate `.env` variables before using them. Warn in dev if any are missing.
- [ ] Optimize for accessibility (ARIA roles, labels, keyboard nav, contrast).
- [ ] Animations must use Framer Motion and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- [ ] Every component must pass the full “Don’t Break the App” checklist before merge.

## 🔐 File & Code Integrity
- [ ] No JSX in `.js` files. Use `.jsx` for anything rendering React components.
- [ ] All import/export paths match the file system exactly (case-sensitive).
- [ ] No missing file references in any page/component.
- [ ] `npm run build` completes with no errors.
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier pass — no warnings.

## ⚙️ Environment & Config
- [ ] All required `.env` variables validated at runtime with safe fallback defaults.
- [ ] CI builds (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) pass lint, build, and tests.
- [ ] Tailwind tokens and utility classes are consistently used.

## 🎨 UI Consistency
- [ ] Light/dark mode visually correct on all components and routes.
- [ ] `.glass`, `.glass-frosted`, `.glass-liquid` used where appropriate.
- [ ] Layouts match Tailwind template structure — no janky spacing.
- [ ] Text contrast over glass is always WCAG 2.1 AA+ compliant.

## ♿ Accessibility (A11y)
- [ ] Interactive components have ARIA attributes.
- [ ] Full keyboard navigation works logically across pages.
- [ ] Focus styles are visible using `.ring-focus` utility.
- [ ] Motion animations respect system `prefers-reduced-motion` settings.

## 🛡️ Security & Session
- [ ] Default new role is `Daily User`.
- [ ] Auth route guards in place with fallback redirects.
- [ ] Tokens securely stored (prefer `httpOnly`; fallback is encrypted localStorage).
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in logs.

## 🚀 Deployment Readiness
- [ ] No dev-only console output or errors.
- [ ] All documentation updated (`README.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, etc.).
- [ ] Smoke/unit/E2E tests run clean locally and via CI.
- [ ] Version bumped or changelog updated.
